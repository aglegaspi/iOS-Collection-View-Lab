Summary

Create an app that loads a list of countries. This time with a Collection View! Feel free to either start fresh with this repo, or refactor your earlier project to use a colleciton view instead. Make sure to make a PR either way and submit that link to Canvas.

Selecting a country will go to a detail view controller with more information about that country, including the conversion rate from their currency into USD.

Endpoints:
- Country List // https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/united
- Exchange Rates // http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key=a17aef5ece92cf36d9c5963f7f4babf1&format=1
- Weather // https://www.metaweather.com/api/

View Controller One:
This view controller should contain a:

Search Bar
- Collection View
- Entering a term in the search bar should load the countries with a name matching the search term. Each cell should have:

- An image of the flag
- The country's name
- The country's capital
- The country's population
- Selecting on a cell should segue to another View Controller


View Controller Two:
- An image of the flag

- The country's name
- The country's capital
- The country's population

Bonus: Combining APIs
The detail View Controller should also show the following properties. You will need to make a different network call to get this information:

The currency and the currency's value in USD
The current weather in the country's capital
